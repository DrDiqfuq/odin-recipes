        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These are burgers, but smoked on a smoker. They get a pretty nice smoke line to them. They also bark up just a tiny bit, which is pretty dope. They also just taste better because who doesn't like smoked meat? Cowards, that's who. Cowards and vegans. And vegans are <em>definitely</em> afraid.</p>

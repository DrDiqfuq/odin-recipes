        <p>This is brisket. It's really good. I smoke using hickory chunks/pellets, because that's my preferred beef flavor profile. Honestly pairs best with a hickory barbecue sauce, but just about any will work. The rub is pretty damn versatile.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 12-18lbs brisket, whole</li>
            <li>2 cups Kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 cups Coarse black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Cayenne pepper powder</li>
            <li>1 cup onion powder</li>
            <li>1 cup garlic powder</li>
            <li>2tbsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>Yellow mustard</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Apple cider vinegar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim the brisket (as one does).</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix your spices. Stir with a fork to evenly mix throughout.</li>
            <li>Rub Brisket down with a thin layer of yellow mustard. The mustard flavor burns off, but the mustard acts as a binding agent for your rub.</li>
            <li>Shake your rub evenly and generously on the brisket, patting it in with your hand, rather than rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>Tightly wrap your brisket in shrink wrap, then refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Mix 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar in your spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Heat your smoker to 180 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li>Insert your thermometer probe into the brisket.</li>
            <li>Fill your aluminum pan 3/4 of the way with water. Place on the coals/grease trap rack, depending on smoker model.</li>
            <li>Place brisket into smoker and close.</li>
            <li>Mist brisket with vinegar/water mix every 45-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>When internal temp reaches 170 degrees, remove brisket from smoker and <strong><em>tightly wrap</em></strong> with aluminum foil or butcher paper.</li>
            <li>Increase smoker temp to 225 degrees and continue smoking until internal temp reaches 203-206.</li>
            <li>Remove from smoker and cut in 1/4 thick strips, against the grain.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, cut into cubes and serve on Hawaiian Rolls (like a slider) with barbecue sauce.</li>
            <li>Promptly die and go to heaven because the cow you just smoked was a holy symbol, elevating the flesh and blood circulating throughout you to near-deific status.</li>
            <li>Conduct a pseudo-rapture (not like the biblical one, though, because that's pretty different).</li>
        </ol>

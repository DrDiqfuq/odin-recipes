            <p>This is a recipe to make chili in a crockpot. It's some pretty good chili. I honestly just kinda eyeball most of the ingredients and adjust by taste after it's cooked for an hour or two. I use vegetable powders primarily because I don't like for there to be too many chunky ingredients, outside of the meat and beans. More a personal preference than anything.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Crockpot</li>
                <li>2.25lbs Ground beef</li>
                <li>1 can pinto beans</li>
                <li>1 can dark red kidney beans</li>
                <li>1 can light red kidney beans</li>
                <li>48oz tomato juice</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
                <li>Onion Powder</li>
                <li>Garlic powder</li>
                <li>Cayenne pepper powder</li>
                <li>Chili powder</li>
                <li>Chipotle Powder</li>
                <li>Diced jalapenos</li>
                <li>Tobasco sauce</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Brown your ground beef on the skillet, drain, and then add to your crockpot.</li>
                <li>Open your beans, drain the water, and add to the crockpot.</li>
                <li>Pour in your 48oz tomato juice.</li>
                <li>Add in diced jalapenos, as well as some of the juice.</li>
                <li>Add a dash of salt, and roughly a fist-sized serving of all other spices. Stir Thoroughly. The juice should be a reddish-brown, though more brown than red.</li>
                <li>Add Tobasco sauce to taste. Stir <em>thoroughly</em></li>
                <li>Cover with lid and set crockpot to low for 8-10 hours.</li>
                <li>After 1-2 hours, open lid and stir. Sample the juice and add more spices/Tobasco as needed, to taste.</li>
                <li>Allow to cook 6-8 hours. Chili is good to server after no fewer than 4 hours, but is best served between 6-8 hours.</li>
                <li>Add a shitload of cheese. Just like, a <strong><em>ridiculous</em></strong> amount of cheese. I'm talking enough cheese to drown the Empire State Building. Though be sure the cheese is shredded, not liquid. That way the fact you drowned a building stands out that much more.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your chili (and probable war crime), nerd.</li>
            </ol>
